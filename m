I need hint from kbuild expert.

My original idea to use "select LIBNVDIMM" is to avoid the
BCACHE_NVM_PAGES option to disappear if LIBNVDIMM is not enabled.
Otherwise if nvdimm driver is not configure, users won't know there is a
BCACHE_NVM_PAGES option unless they read bcache Kconfig file.

But I see nvdimm's Kconfig, it uses "depends on BLK_DEV", I understand
it is acceptable that LIBNVDIMM option to disappear from "make
menuconfig" if BLK_DEV is not enabled.

For such condition, which one is the proper way to set the dependence ?
- Change "select LIBNVDIMM" and "select DAX" to "depends on LIBNVDIMM"
and "depends on DAX" in bcache Kconfig
- Or change "depends on BLK_DEV" to "select BLK_DEV" in nvdimm Kconfig.


I want to ask for a proper way to handle such dependence, and I will
follow the guide for now and in future.

Thanks in advance for the advice.
