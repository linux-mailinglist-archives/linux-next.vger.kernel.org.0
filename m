Thanks Robin. I'm pretty sure this is the reason. I thought I fixed
all ACPI cases, but clearly I missed this one. I'll send out a patch
for this today. If you think there are any other places I missed
please let me know. I'll try some git grep foo to see if I missed any
other instances of fwnode ops being set.
