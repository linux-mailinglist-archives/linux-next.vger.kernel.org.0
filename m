It would be really great if we could move forward. While the fix (which
has been dropped from mmotm) is not super urgent I would really like to
understand how it could hit the observed behavior. Can we double check
that the debugging patch really doesn't trigger (e.g.
s@trace_printk@printk in the first step)? I have checked it again but
do not see any potential code path which would be affected by the patch
yet not trigger any output. But another pair of eyes would be really
great.
