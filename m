According to my understanding and testing on my machine, it seems we need blank
lines only before and after the blocks.

So, this was needed to make 'make htmldocs' quiet on my machine.

But above two blank lines were not really needed to make 'make htmldocs' calm,
at least on my setup.  Many other documents also don't have this kind of blank
line.

Interestingly, 'make htmldocs' didn't complain even if I don't put this blank
line.  But for consistency (see the beginning of sysctl/vm.rst), I think having
this would be good.

Again, same to the reason above, it seems above two blank lines are not really
needed.

I have no strong opinion about these, though.  Having four more blank lines
that might unnecessary is obviously no problem.
