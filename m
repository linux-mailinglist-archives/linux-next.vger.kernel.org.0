I am very sorry for all these errors, As usual, I pushed this branch to
my 0-day repository last Thursday and got a green light. But it
regularly happens, like this week, that I received an error report
even after that. This time the robot discovered the mistake at the
same time as you...

Anyway, it is now fixed and I pushed a hopefully fine nand/next branch.

As always, thank you very much for your time.
